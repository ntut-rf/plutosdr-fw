		  Optimise for fast math functions, at the expense of accuracy.

		  Say 'y' if you need speed and can live with inaccuracies in
		  the results. Say 'n' (the default) if accuracy is of utmost
		  importance.

		  This basically uses gcc's -Ofast optimisation level, which in
		  turn is basically using gcc's -ffast-math. See the gcc manual
		  for what this means.
