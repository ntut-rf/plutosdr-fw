	  Library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms in quad precision.

	  This library computes Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in one
	  or more dimensions. It is extremely fast. This package
	  contains the shared library version of the fftw libraries in
	  double precision.

	  Compile fftw in quadruple precision, i.e. use '__float128' for
	  floating point type.
